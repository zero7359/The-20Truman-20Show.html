Unlike the finished product, it was more of a science-fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script, and set up production at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million—$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.</p><p>The film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71st_Academy_Awards">the 71st Academy Awards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56th_Golden_Globe_Awards">56th Golden Globe Awards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52nd_British_Academy_Film_Awards">52nd British Academy Film Awards</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Awards">The Saturn Awards</a>. The Truman Show has been analyzed as <u>a thesis on Christianity, metaphilosophy, simulated reality, existentialism, surveillance, privacy and reality television.</u></p>
